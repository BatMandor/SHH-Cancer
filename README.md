# SHH-Cancer
Sonic the hedgehog gene

The Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signalling pathway, key in embryonic development and cell growth regulation, becomes cancer-causing when mutations in SMO and PTCH 1 trigger uncontrolled cell proliferation. Although the link between the SHH pathway and cancer progression is well-known, treatment options are still significantly limited, especially targeting molecular SHH subtypes, displaying the unmet need for more effective and personalised treatment plans. This research aims to create a predictive regression model to estimate survival rates of patients with SHH mutations, intending to produce more tailored treatment plans by allowing early intervention for high-risk, low-survival rate patients. By providing survival rate data, patients can make more informed decisions, enabling for treatment choices that alignwith both personal and religious preferences.

In this study, we created a regression model with a 0.76 R-squared value, showcasing its capability in predicting cancer survival rates. By examining gene sequences, we identified specific gene positions potentially linked to cancer risk, underlining the importance of genetic mutations in cancer development. Through a detailed comparison of mutation types, including frame-shift deletions, insertions, and missense mutations, we gained insights into their differential impact on survival rates, contributing to a deeper understanding of how genetic variations influence cancer prognosis. This work demonstrates the application of machine learning and bioinformatics in cancer biology and highlights the importance of genetic analysis in cancer research. Future implications will explore how we can integrate our model with clinical data from ongoing trials and evaluate the long-term benefit in the use of model informed treatments on the quality of life.
