# SHH-Cancer
Sonic the hedgehog gene

    The aim of this project is to collect and analyse genomic data to find SHH mutations linked to a specific (edit this) cancer and developing a risk scoring system and link it to mutation type of SHH gene and the frequency to determine an individual's risk of getting cancer (end-product).
